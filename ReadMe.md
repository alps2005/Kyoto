# Programming 3 Project 2: Pokemon Finder

This was a challenge because of the style of the website. Working with the API was quite easy, but the arrangement of the navbar and the cards was **painful**. In order to make a webpage responsive, it is **crucial** to understand the concepts of flex, containers, and how the objects contained react to the changes in the screen real estate. I'll try better next time.
